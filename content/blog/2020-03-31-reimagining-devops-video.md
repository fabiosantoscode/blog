Last week, DVC was part of [DivOps](https://divops.org/), a fully remote
conference led by women in DevOps. DevOps, to the newly anointed, is a
discipline bringing together strong software engineering practices with speedy
development cycles. As machine learning is finding its way into just about
_every_ area of research and development, we're going to need to come up with
some conventions and tools for integrating machine learning and big data with
software development.

I gave a lightning talk about how we'll have to rethink our software development
practices in the age of machine learning. It's got a focus on
[CI/CD](https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html), a way of structuring
workflows that we think can streamline exchanges between data scientists and
software engineers. And, it's got fuzzy animals. Check it out here:

If you liked this, you'll also want to check out the next talk in the DivOps
playlist by
[Anna Petrovicheva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-petrovicheva-44b24673/),
Founder and CEO of Xperience AI. Anna's talk goes deeper into developing best
practices for software engineering with deep learning.

All the talks from DivOps are
[available online now](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVeJCYrrCemgbA1cWYn3qzdgba20xJS8V),
so please check out the YouTube channel. And stay tuned on our blog for more
CI/CD discussions coming soon...
